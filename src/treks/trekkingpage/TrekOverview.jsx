            If there is one journey the spirit should walk in this life, it is
            the path to the foothill of mighty Mount Everest. The trail winds
            through the far northeast of Nepal, resting in the quiet heart of
            Solukhumbu.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg font-sans text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Walk, explore, and discover the path once taken by the legendary
            Everest pioneers—Hillary and Norgay—who stepped on the mountain and
            touched the top of the world in ’53. This iconic trail weaves
            through Sherpa land and quaint villages, up to the foothills of
            gigantic snow-capped peaks exceeding 8,000 m.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg font-sans text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Though the trek is rated moderate to challenging, no technical
            climbing skills are required—you just need your body to be ready,
            and your mind to embrace the adventure. Even without prior Himalayan
            experience, your spirit will carry you.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg font-sans text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Expect 5–8 hours of daily hiking, with distances varying between
            10–12 km. The round-trip from Lukla to Everest Base Camp is roughly
            130 km (80 mi), starting at 2,860 m and rising to a high point of
            5,455 m on Kala Patthar.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg font-sans text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Your journey begins with an exhilarating flight from Kathmandu to
            Lukla, then on foot through Sherpa settlements—Phakding, Namche,
            Tengboche, and Dingboche—each alive with fluttering prayer flags,
            colorful monasteries, and Himalayan panoramas.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg font-sans text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Beyond the peaks, you’ll meet the Sherpa people, visit their ancient
            monasteries, and immerse yourself in their resilient way of life.
            Acclimatization days in Namche Bazaar and Dingboche ensure a
            balanced pace and deep cultural connection.
