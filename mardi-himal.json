This 6-day trek starts from Pokhara and takes you through pristine forests, rhododendron groves, and high alpine meadows to Mardi Himal viewpoint at 4,500m. The trek offers excellent mountain photography opportunities, authentic village experiences, and some of the region's most breathtaking panoramic views. Unlike popular trekking routes, Mardi Himal remains relatively untouched and less commercialized, offering true wilderness experience."
