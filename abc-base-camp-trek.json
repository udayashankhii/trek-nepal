              "Annapurna Base Camp (4,130m) sits at the foot of Annapurna I (8,091m), one of the world's most beautiful and dangerous mountains. This 10-day trek follows the Modi Khola valley through lush rhododendron forests, alpine meadows, and offers stunning direct views of Annapurna's north face, Machhapuchhare, and surrounding peaks. The trek is relatively short but offers incredible mountain scenery and fewer crowds than popular Everest Base Camp trek. You'll stay in teahouses throughout with authentic mountain village experiences. The final push to ABC includes passing through pristine wilderness and glacial terrain."
