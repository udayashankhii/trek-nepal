This 7-day journey takes you through the Kali Gandaki gorge - the world's deepest gorge - to the sacred Muktinath Temple at 3,800m. Unlike Upper Mustang, no restricted permit is needed, making it very popular. Trek through traditional Thakali villages, apple orchards, and experience authentic Mustang culture. Muktinath is sacred for both Hindus (Temple of Vishnu) and Buddhists (108 water taps). The trek is shorter, easier, and can be extended with the famous Annapurna Circuit."
