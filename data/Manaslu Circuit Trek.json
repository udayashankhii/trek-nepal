              "Manaslu Circuit Trek is one of Nepal's most spectacular and challenging trekking adventures, circumnavigating Mt. Manaslu (8,163m), the eighth highest mountain in the world [web:2][web:7]. This 16-day trek traverses the restricted Manaslu Conservation Area, crossing the dramatic Larkya La Pass at 5,106m - one of the highest trekking passes in Nepal [web:7][web:9]. The route follows the ancient salt-trading path along the Budhi Gandaki River valley, ascending through subtropical forests, terraced farmlands, and high alpine meadows before entering the Tibetan Buddhist cultural heartland [web:2][web:17]. Remote villages like Samagaon, Lho, and Samdo offer authentic cultural experiences with ancient monasteries, prayer flags, and warm hospitality [web:17][web:20]. As a restricted area trek, Manaslu requires special permits and a licensed guide, which preserves its pristine character and limits tourist numbers [web:12][web:16]. The circuit offers stunning 360-degree mountain panoramas including Manaslu, Himlung Himal, Cheo Himal, and the Annapurna range [web:7][web:10]."
