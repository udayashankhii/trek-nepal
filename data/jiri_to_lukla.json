Over 11 days, you'll trek through the pristine Gokyo Valley to a chain of five spectacular turquoise glacial lakes nested at 4,790m. The highlight is the ascent to Gokyo Ri (5,357m), which offers 360-degree panoramic views of four 8,000m peaks: Everest, Lhotse, Cho Oyu, and Makalu. The trek features Nepal's largest glacier (Ngozumpa Glacier), authentic Sherpa villages with virtually no tourism infrastructure, and a sense of wilderness and discovery missing from the main EBC route."

If you want to reach high altitude (5,300m+) while avoiding the crowds and commercialization of the main EBC route, this is your trek. If you value pristine natural beauty, turquoise lakes, and off-the-beaten-path Sherpa culture over a famous base camp visit, Gokyo offers a superior experience.",
