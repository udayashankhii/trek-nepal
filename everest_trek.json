Over 10 days, you'll experience authentic Sherpa culture, visit ancient monasteries, and witness stunning mountain views without pushing into extreme altitude. Maximum altitude is only 3,880m (Everest View Hotel) - well below altitude sickness risk. The trek features proper acclimatization time in Namche Bazaar, scenic walks to key viewpoints (Everest View Hotel, Syangboche, Tengboche Monastery), and opportunities to explore local life. Perfect for busy professionals, families with teenagers, and anyone seeking genuine Himalayan experience without 5,000m+ peaks or technical climbing."
