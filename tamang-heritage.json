              "Tamang Heritage Trail is an exclusive cultural immersion program through the beautiful high country between Ganesh and Langtang Himal ranges, situated on ancient and present caravan and salt trade routes of Nepal to Tibet/China. The Tamang tribe is believed to have settled and migrated in northern Himalayan range of Nepal since ancient times. Brought to Kathmandu Valley by King Srong-sen Gampo of Tibet in 7th Century AD as cavalry division, they maintain traditions from Southern Tibet's Uichang region after migrating from inner Mongolia. This trek takes you along Nagthali ridge at 3,154m offering tremendous panorama of snow-clad peaks towards Ganesh Himal and Langtang Himal ranges. Experience serene forests with rhododendrons, pines, and fir trees, stunning when flowers bloom in spring. Enjoy refreshing natural hot springs and immerse yourself in local customs while finishing at Syabrubesi."
