              "Gosaikunda Lake is the holiest lake in Hindu culture situated at 4,312m elevation, believed to have originated from the digging of earth by Lord Shiva's Trishul (holy three-pointed sword). According to legend, a black rock in the lake's middle is the head of Lord Shiva. Thousands of Hindu pilgrims visit during the full moon festival in August (Janai Purnima). This 11-day trek combines natural heritage with glacial landscapes, intense forests with wildflowers, animal species, and heart-touching natural scenery. The route passes through oak and rhododendron forests, crosses glacial moraines, and encounters typical Tamang villages in Langtang National Park."
