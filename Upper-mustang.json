              "The Upper Mustang Trek is one of Nepal's most exclusive and culturally significant treks. This 14-day journey takes you from Pokhara through the Kali Gandaki gorge - the world's deepest gorge - to the ancient walled city of Lo Manthang at 3,840m. The trek is restricted and requires special permits, preserving its authentic Tibetan culture, Buddhist monasteries, and desert landscapes. You'll explore the mystical Chhoser caves, visit Lo Gekar Gompa (Ghar Gompa), trek through ancient caravan trade routes, and experience the unique Loba people's traditions. This is the most famous Mustang trek, perfect for culture-focused trekkers seeking the 'Forbidden Kingdom.'"
